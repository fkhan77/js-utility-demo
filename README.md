# js-utility-demo
JS scripts for an accompanying talk on using JavaScript utility libraries

## Setup
`$ npm install`

## Usage
Running the demo (Formatted for illustrative purposes - make sure to comment out the parts you don't want to run)

`$ node demo.js`

Running the performance tests

`$ node performanceTest.js`

Note : Take these performance results with a grain of salt, apparently these results change quite a bit depending on your execution environent, machine and other factors. The actual performance is very similar. All in all, if you're deciding between replicated methods in lodash and native methods it's proabbly better to just stick with native.
